# Github API Code Test
## Time: 
~45 Minutes dev time, 15 minutes wrap up, questions and conversation

## Language: 
Your choice. Pick the language and/or frameworks you are most comfortable with.

## Project Summary: 
Today, we will build a simple interface to the Github API that allows a user to be authenticated to the Github service and perform various actions. You can use your personal Github account for this if you like.

Expect to verbally communicate your thought processes and test code when appropriate and possible. You are free to use available libraries for interfacing with the Github API, pull code from your previous projects, Google anything you need to or refer to StackOverflow or any other references you might need, including Github API docs.

Further, you can solve this anyway you want, as long as you write code to do it, whether that means a command line interface,  an api/web interface, etc - it's up to you.

The goal of this project is to understand your thought processes and collaborative, communication and working style. Be sure to think through any potential edge cases or test scenarios that might be important.

You are not expected to finish all of the requirements of the project — when we’re reaching the end of the time, we’ll recap and discuss our progress so far and you may be asked several questions about decisions you made in the test. 

An understanding of three legged OAuth 1.0 is helpful to complete all the specs of this challenge - https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html.

## Specs:

- As a user, I should be able to authenticate to the Github service using a live Github account. 
- As a user, I should be able to view the profile of the Github user I am signed in with.
- As a user, I should be able to list and paginate the public repositories contributed to by the user I am signed in with.
- As a user, I should be able to file an issue on this test Github repo.
- As a user, I should be able to put a comment on the issue I have just created.
